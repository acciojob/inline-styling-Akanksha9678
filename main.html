		<p>Many flowers are possible to eat, and they have fed and sweetened many generations. The flowers form an integral part of many foods, such as salads and soaps, and are also used in jellies, jams, wine, and even tea production.</p>

		<p>Most rose species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers being native to North America and a few to Europe and northwest Africa. Roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult to determine basic species. Fewer than 10 species, mostly native to Asia, were involved in the crossbreeding that ultimately produced todayâ€™s many types of garden roses.</p>
